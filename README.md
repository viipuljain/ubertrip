This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze Uber trip data and predict trip durations.

Overview
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the duration of an Uber trip based on various factors such as the starting point, destination, distance, and time of day. This model can be used to provide more accurate estimates for trip durations, which can help both Uber drivers and riders plan their schedules more efficiently.

Data
The data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, and includes information about Uber trips taken in New York City in 2014. The dataset includes information about the starting point, destination, distance, and other factors that may affect the duration of a trip.

Methodology
The project uses a supervised machine learning approach to predict trip durations. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and various regression models are tested to determine which one performs best on the data.

Once a model is selected, it is fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning to further improve its accuracy. The final model is then used to make predictions on new data, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error and root mean squared error.

Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of XX%, which is significantly better than other models tested. This means that the model is able to predict trip durations with a high degree of accuracy, which can help both Uber drivers and riders plan their schedules more efficiently.

Conclusion
Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in analyzing and predicting trip durations for Uber trips. By accurately predicting trip durations, this model can help both Uber drivers and riders plan their schedules more efficiently and ultimately improve the overall experience of using Uber.
